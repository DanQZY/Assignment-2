Refection :

This visit made me appreciate and realize how much effort UTM puts into using technology to benefit students and staff. It also encouraged me to learn more about digital tools and how I can use them to succeed in my studies and future job.

Overall, the visit was inspiring and showed me how technology is an important part of modern education and work. Iâ€™m grateful for the opportunity to learn more about UTMDigital and its role in improving our university experience.
